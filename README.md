# Automatic-Label-Generation-for-Radiology-Report
A text processing tool that generates specified labels based on text content of radiology reports written by human radiologists. Labels indicate presence or absence of given condition/finding in the text description. 

Note: the original CXR report dataset cannot be uploaded due to large file size. Only the notebooks are available so far :(
